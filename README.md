# PitPat Activation without the App
If you're looking at this, you're someone who cares a lot about your ability to use the technology that you bought and paid for. If you're like me, you'll appreciate this article.

## Quick Answer
I assume you just want your treadmill to work. This is what I had figured out is the solution in order to get the device to function without an app:

`MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, and HOLD MINUS for 3 SECONDS`

After this, you should hear a beep. This signals to you that the treadmill is now in a state where it is usable. Press START/STOP to make the treadmill begin or stop spinning, press MINUS or PLUS to decrease or increase speed. **Upon restart, this will not persist.**

To keep the treadmill in an "activated" state, here are the steps you need to follow:

1. `MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, and HOLD PLUS for 3 SECONDS`
2. You are now in a menu that does not provide any output. Follow these next instructions carefully.
3. `MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, and HOLD PLUS for an unknown period of time` (I suggest holding PLUS for at least 20 seconds, as failure to execute the correct actions may result in your device becoming unusable.)
4. Apparently, during the final press of the PLUS button, you'll hear one beep, and then a few seconds later, you'll hear more. My treadmill made no audible sound during this part.


## Story
I recently had a PitPat treadmill gifted to me. I love treadmills, so I was very excited to receive this package. The issue, however, was that when I unboxed the device, it had several messages stating that I "must use" the app named "PitPat" to operate the treadmill.

The treadmill comes with a remote, with only three buttons: MINUS, PAUSE/PLAY, and PLUS. Upon pressing both the PAUSE/PLAY and PLUS buttons, error sounds would occur. "beep-beep-beep!" However, I noticed that when I pressed the "DOWN" button, no error sound would occur. It would beep once. "beep!" I could press the MINUS key three times, before it would eventually beep at me. Pressing MINUS four times resulted in another error. "beep-beep-beep!" 

So, after trial and error, I found that the combination of MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, MINUS resulted in no error sounds, but any buttons pressed after this would result in a "beep-beep-beep!" with no change in behavior. I was not going to resort to the usage of a proprietary mobile application in order to operate my treadmill, so I continued to try at random button combinations.

After some persistence, I was able to find that holding the final MINUS keypress would result in the treadmill beeping once. After this keypress, the treadmill operated just as it should. The "PAUSE/PLAY" button would cause a three-second timer to occur, and after which, the treadmill would begin to function as any normal treadmill should: The motor began spinning! MINUS and PLUS could be used as speed controls, and I was able to use my treadmill as if I'd bought it from any reasonable manufacturer.

There was a problem here, though. Every time I powered the treadmill ON, it would require the password I described above to be entered. This was interesting, but I wasn't going to keep it working in this way. After all, I assumed that they added this as some sort of "factory test" mode so that company members would not have to use their own terrible app in order to operate the device in testing scenarios.

After considering the idea, I eventually decided to call the company and ask for assistance in using the treadmill without the app. They told me about a different sequence of buttons that I hadn't tried before. I recorded the call, and put the sequence they gave me above. Let's all hope they don't "fix" this in their future models, because I do not want to have to do this again.
