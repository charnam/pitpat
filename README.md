# Activating a Handleless PitPat Treadmill without the App
If you're looking at this, you're someone who cares a lot about your ability to use the technology that you bought and paid for without a subscription and without an online service. If you're like me, you'll appreciate this documentation.

**All information in this article is strictly for treadmills created WITHOUT handles.** If your treadmill comes with a handle, you'll probably need to find a different article. My model arrived with a remote, and this guide relies solely on that. As well as this, I have reason to believe the handleless and handled models are very different internally. Be careful!

## Quick Answer
I assume you just want your treadmill to work. This is what I had figured out is the solution in order to get the device to function without an app:

`MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, and HOLD MINUS for 3 SECONDS`

After this, you should hear a beep. This signals to you that the treadmill is now in a state where it is usable. Press START/STOP to make the treadmill begin or stop spinning, press MINUS or PLUS to decrease or increase speed. **Upon restart, this will not persist.**

To **permanently** keep the treadmill in an "activated" state, here are the buttons you should press:

`MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, and HOLD PLUS for 3 SECONDS`

## Contributing
If you have a treadmill with a handle, call customer support for help setting the treadmill up (always remember to have kindness with support agents!) and submit an issue detailing exactly what the agent told you to do. I recommend recording your call as well as exactly what you do with the buttons, and writing down, clearly, what steps were performed. Make note of the timing of your button presses, including exactly how many seconds a given action takes. It's unfortunate that my instructions are vague in that way.

## Story
I recently had a PitPat treadmill gifted to me. I love treadmills, so I was very excited to receive this package. The issue, however, was that when I unboxed the device, it had several messages stating that I "must use" the app named "PitPat" to operate the treadmill.

The treadmill comes with a remote, with only three buttons: MINUS, PAUSE/PLAY, and PLUS. Upon pressing both the PAUSE/PLAY and PLUS buttons, error sounds would occur. "beep-beep-beep!" However, I noticed that when I pressed the "DOWN" button, no error sound would occur. It would beep once. "beep!" I could press the MINUS key three times, before it would eventually beep at me. Pressing MINUS four times resulted in another error. "beep-beep-beep!" 

So, after trial and error, I found that the combination of MINUS, MINUS, MINUS, PLUS, MINUS resulted in no error sounds, but any buttons pressed after this would result in a "beep-beep-beep!" with no change in behavior. I was not going to resort to the usage of a proprietary mobile application in order to operate my treadmill, so I continued to try at random button combinations.

After some persistence, I was able to find that holding the final MINUS keypress would result in the treadmill beeping once. After this keypress, the treadmill operated just as it should. The "PAUSE/PLAY" button would cause a three-second timer to occur, and after which, the treadmill would begin to function as any normal treadmill should: The motor began spinning! MINUS and PLUS could be used as speed controls, and I was able to use my treadmill as if I'd bought it from any other reasonable manufacturer.

There was a problem here, though. Every time I powered the treadmill ON, it would require the password I described above to be entered. This was interesting, but I wasn't going to keep it working in this way. After all, I assumed that they added what I was using as some sort of "factory test" mode so that company members would not have to use their own terrible app in order to operate the device in testing scenarios.

After considering the idea, I eventually decided to call the company and ask for assistance in using the treadmill without the app. They told me about a different sequence of buttons that I hadn't tried before. I recorded the call, and put the sequence they gave me above. Let's all hope they don't "fix" this in their future models, because I do not want anyone else to be subjected to a horrible, proprietary, internet-active mobile app.
